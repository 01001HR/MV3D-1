# Description

This is lidar point cloud data preprocessing for MV3D. 

The delay between successive LiDAR frames is currently set as 1 second (1000ms) in a global variable named "delay". This can be altered to slow down or speed up the data playback.

The Kiti dataset import prototype is based on s-nepal 's work on https://github.com/bostondiditeam/kitti/tree/master/kitti_velodyne_reader

## Requirements:

--> CMake 2.8 or higher

--> PCL 1.2 or higher

--> OpenCV 

## To compile the code:
(Please note, if you are using anaconda or miniconda, try to exclude them in system path before compile, as conda has
 its own .so libraries, it can cause some .so file linkage problem.)
 
--> Run cmake .

--> Run make


## To run the executable generated by make:

--> ./velodyne_reader

## Suggestions

### To install PCL, use the following command on an Ubuntu terminal

sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake libpcl1.7 libpcl-dev pcl-tools

If you get the error No rule to make target '/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libproj.so' while running the make command, do the following:

sudo apt install libproj-dev
    
Add the following line to the CMakeLists.txt file and run cmake . again to generate the Makefile:
		
list(REMOVE_ITEM PCL_LIBRARIES "vtkproj4")

Press "R" on the keyboard once the PCL window appears in order to normalize the camera view angle. Otherwise, simply zoom out using the mouse roller.
